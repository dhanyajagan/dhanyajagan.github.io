My personal academic website, under construction 🛠️
Currently @ UofT doing a PhD in Computer Science! Interested in machine learning and its applications to the life sciences, specifically protein design and modeling protein dynamics. In my free time, I enjoy DJ'ing 💿, photography 📷, playing the trumpet 🎺, and singing 🎶.
